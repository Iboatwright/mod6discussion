Write a program that will allow a student to enter their name and then
ask them to solve 10 mathematical equations.  The program should
display two random numbers that are to be added, such as:
      247
    + 129
The program should allow the student to enter the answer.  The program
should then display whether the answer was right or wrong, and
accumulate the correct values.  After the 10 questions are asked,
calculate the average correct.  Then display the student name, the
number correct, and the average correct in both decimal and percentage
format.

In addition to any system functions you may use, you might consider the
following functions:
    A function that allows the student to enter their name.
    A function that gets two random numbers, anywhere from 1 to 500.
    A function that displays the equation and asks the user to enter their answer.
    A function that checks to see if the answer is right and accumulates the number right.
    A function that calculates the results.
    A function that displays the student name, the number right, and the average right.

Your sample output might look as follows (random numbers will be different):

    Enter Student Name: Katie
    What is the answer to the following equation
    424 + 28
    What is the sum: 472
    Wrong

    What is the answer to the following equation
    163 + 233
    What is the sum: 396
    Right

    What is the answer to the following equation
    285 + 453
    What is the sum: 688
    Wrong

    Etc…(through 10 iterations)

    Information for student:  Katie
    The number right:  5
    The average right is 0.50 or 50.0 %
